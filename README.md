# simset_simpet
This is a slightly tweaked version of SimSET (http://depts.washington.edu/simset/html/simset_main.html), which includes a Dockerfile that makes SimSET runnable as a Docker container. 

We have also added some modifications to include _89Zr_ as a viable isotope for simulation.

**I am not the developer of SimSET, just a user. Full credit for the development of SimSET goes to Professor Robert Harrison and the SimSET Team at the University of Washington.**
